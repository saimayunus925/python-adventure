A text-based adventure game in Python. I just need to come up with a good story and back it up with coding skills.

Hmmm...

OK, idea.

1) Give the hero some traits - not sure what to do with these. Maybe use them for dialogue options?
2) Give the hero powers/skills - each one is connected to some # of attack points.
3) Give the hero an initial amount of health: attacks decrease the health. 

Create a Character class: the Hero, Villain, and NPC classes will inherit from this class. 

Don't make it an overtly political game, or employers will be mad. If you must put in politics, make it 
milquetoast "underdog hero vs. evil executives" type stuff. 

OK, let's come up with an idea for a game plot. It shouldn't be totally stupid, and it should be something people 
can relate to. 

So because of the Hero/Villain/NPC characters, the health, the attack points, this game will probably
take place in a different world. Oh, yeah, I also need classes for different creatures.
