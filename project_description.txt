A text-based adventure game in Python. I just need to come up with a good story and back it up with coding skills.

Hmmm...

OK, idea.

1) Give the hero some traits - not sure what to do with these. Maybe use them for dialogue options?
2) Give the hero powers/skills - each one is connected to some # of attack points.
3) Give the hero an initial amount of health: attacks decrease the health. 
4)
